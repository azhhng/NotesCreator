General Layout of the Nervous System
Complexity of human brain
- Average human brain weighs about 1.3kg
- A network of neurons
– 100 billion neurons
– Each neuron having about 1000 synaptic connections
- Total 100 trillion connections
How is the nervous system organized overall?
  

Today we will learn……
- General layout of the nervous system
- Structures protecting the nervous system
- Cellular components of the nervous system
- Anatomy of major structures of the nervous system (brain and spinal cord)

General Layout of the Nervous System
Nervous system is divided into two main divisions
- Central Nervous System (CNS)
– Brain (inside the skull)
– Spinal Cord (inside the spine)
- Peripheral Nervous System 
(PNS)
– outside of the skull and spine
– bring information into the CNS and carry signals out of the CNS
– most of PNS nerves project from spinal cord except the 12 pairs of nerves called cranial nerves which project from the brain.
  

Before we learn more details…..
There are some definitions we need to remember
- Nerve: Collection of axons outside the CNS.
- Tract: Collection of axons inside the CNS.
Afferent tract or nerves : carries information into a region of interest
Efferent tract or nerves : carries information away from a region of interest
Neurons are often found as a cluster 
- Ganglion (pl. ganglia): A cluster of neuron cell bodies outside the CNS
- Nucleus: A cluster of neuron cell bodies inside the CNS

General Layout of the Nervous System
PNS is further divided into two subdivisions: 
Somatic nervous system and autonomic nervous system 
What distinguishes these two system?
  

Anatomy of Somatic Nervous System
Somatic nervous system interacts with the body’s external environment through body surface and skeletal muscles
- Receives sensory information from sensory organs (e.g., skin, eyes, ear, etc.) and controls movements of skeletal muscles
- Afferent nerves carry information from various body parts close to external environment to the CNS –
(i.e. sensory nerves)
- Efferent nerves carry information from the CNS to the skeletal muscle –
(i.e. motor nerves)

Anatomy of Autonomic Nervous System
In contrast, autonomic nervous system interacts with the body’s internal environment (internal organs)
- Afferent nerves carry sensory signals from internal organs to the CNS – sensory nerves
- Efferent nerves carry motor signals from the 
CNS to internal organs – motor nerves
- Operates without direct control by our consciousness
- Autonomic efferent motor nerves are divided into two systems based on their structure and funtion. 
- Sympathetic division
- Parasympathetic division

Sympathetic VS. parasympathetic division 
Functional difference

Sympathetic VS. parasympathetic division 
Structural difference
- Sympathetic nerves and parasympathetic nerves emerge from different positions along the spine
- Need to know the basic anatomy of the spine

Anatomy of Autonomic Nervous System
Human spine is composed of 33 bones called vertebrae.
- Cervical spine - 7 vertebrae in the neck.
- Thoracic spine - 12 vertebrae in the upper back.
- Lumbar spine - 5 vertebrae in lower back.
- Sacrum spine - 5 fused vertebrae.
- Coccyx (ˈkäk-siks) spine - 4 fused vertebrae.

Anatomy of Autonomic Nervous System
Sympathetic motor nerves project from spinal motor neurons in the middle portion of the spinal cord (the lumbar and thoracic spine regions).
- Prepares body for vigorous activity in threatening situations (“Fight or flight” )
- increases heart rate 
- facilitates breathing
- increases sweating
- dilates pupil
- inhibits digestion
- And many others…..
- Collectively increases arousal level

Anatomy of Autonomic Nervous System
Parasympathetic motor nerves project from the brain and the sacral regions of the spinal cord.
- promotes vegetative, nonemergency responses in various organs (“Rest and restore/digest” – leads to psychological relaxation)
- Decreases heart rate 
- Decreases breathing
- Constricts pupil
- Stimulate digestion 

Autonomic nerve system circuit 
Autonomic motor nerves control muscles and glands in the target organs. 
: spinal cord (or brainstem)
: targets 
(e.g. heart, lung, stomach, eye)

Autonomic nerve system circuit 
- Starter neurons (i.e. first order neurons) are in the spinal cord and connected to the second order neurons
: spinal cord. (1st order neurons)
: targets 
(e.g. heart, lung, stomach, eye)

Autonomic nerve system circuit 
- Starter neurons (i.e. first order neurons) are in the spinal cord and connected to the second order neurons
: spinal cord
- Second order neurons of the sympathetic
system are near the spinal cord
- Second order neurons of the parasympathetic
system are near the target organs
: targets 
(e.g. heart, lung, stomach, eye)

Anatomy of Autonomic Nervous System
target organs of autonomic motor l
nerves receive inputs from both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.
Sympathetic and parasympathetic l
nerves generally produce opposite effects
Balance between the two systems, l
depending on situation, determine the activity of target organs.

General Layout of the Nervous System
Let’s go through what we have learned so far……
  

General Layout of the Nervous System
Most PNS nerves project from spinal cord except the 12 nerves projecting from the brain, called cranial nerves
  

The Cranial Nerves
There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves (I to XII), mostly serving the head and neck
- Enter/exit at the brain stem 
: sensation of touch to 
- In some cases,  face
exclusively sensory or motor 
Tongue muscle
fiber
- In other cases,
: taste 
Neck and shoulder muscle sensation
contains both sensory and  pain sensation:
motor fibers
Audition
: taste sensation

- General layout of the nervous system
- Structures protecting the nervous system
- Cellular components of the nervous system
- Anatomy of major structures of the nervous system

Structures that protect the central nervous system
The brain and spinal cord is the most protected system in the body
three structures
Protected by 
- Bones (skull and vertebrae)
- Membranes (meninges)
- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
You can see all three protective components in a cross section of the brain

Three meninges (membranes)
- Brain is covered by three membranes collectively called meninges 
(singlular: menix – greek word for ‘covering’)
1. Dura mater – outermost membrane 
(tough, leatherlike consistency)
2. Arachnoid membrane –
appearance resembling spider web
3. Pia mater – adheres to the surface of the brain
  

Three meninges (membranes)
- Blood vessels pass through a space between pia and arachoid
membranes
- This space is called subarachnoid space
- Subarachnoid space is filled with fluid called cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF)
  

Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and Ventricles 
Side view Top view
CSF: what is it for? And how is it maintained?
- CSF has two main functions:
– Acts as a shock absorber (mechanical cushion)
– Provides an exchange medium between blood and brain (nutritional support)
- Brain contains CSF in a series of chambers.
- These chambers are called the ventricles
- Four ventricles in the brain: two lateral, one third, one 

Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and Ventricles 
1. CSF is produced by a network of blood vessels that protrude

Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and Ventricles 
2. CSF leaves the ventricles through holes in the fourth ventricles and travel along

- Cellular components of the nervous system
- Anatomy of major structures of the nervous system

Cells of the Nervous System
the nervous system consists of two types of cells:
- neurons (or nerve cells)
- glia (or glial cells)

Cells of the Nervous System
Neurons 
- Specialized cells for the reception, conduction, and transmission of electrochemical signals
- Many sizes and shapes
Let’s look into external and internal anatomy of neurons

The Neuron: Structure and Function
the neuron consists of:
- a soma (or cell body body)
- an axon
- Axon terminals
- Dendrites

The Neuron: Structure and Function
Soma (cell body)
- consists of a number of organelles including the nucleus, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria
- these perform various functions including protein synthesis and production of energy for cellular activity.

The Neuron: Structure and Function
The Dendrites
- extend from soma like branches
- function àreceive information from other neurons (i.e., the 
“antennae” of the system)
- covered with receptors (protein molecules that detect neurotransmitters)

The Neuron: Structure and Function
The Axon 
- highly specialized structure found only in neurons 
- function àto carry signals 
(information) over distances within the nervous system (i. e., the “wires” of the system) 

The Neuron: Structure and Function
Axon Terminals 
- region that makes contact with other neurons or cells
- Where the transfer of information occurs

The Neuron: Structure and Function
Synapse
-the point of contact between one neuron’s axon terminal and another neuron (or other cell type)
-a specialized junction where communication between cells occurs

The Neuron: Structure and Function (recap)
- Input zone–receives information from other cells through dendrites
- Integration zone–a region where inputs are combined and transformed
- Conduction zone–single axon leads away from the cell body and transmits the electrical impulse
- Output zone–axon terminals at the end of the axon communicate activity to other cells

The Neuron: Structure and Function
Do every neurons look like this?
.......NO!

The Neuron: Structure and Function
Types of Neurons
- neurons differ in their shape, size, and function 

Cells of the Nervous System
the nervous system consists of two types of cells:
- neurons (or nerve cells)
- glia (or glial cells)

Glia
- serve to support the functions of neurons (i.e., supporting cells) 
- have many functions in the nervous system 
- e. g., structural support, insulation, nutrition
- Recent evidence for glial communication and modulatory effects of glia on neuronal communication

Glia
- Four classes of Glial cells:
- Oligodendrocytes
- Schwann cells
- Astrocytes
- Microglia

Glia: Structure and Function
Oligodendrocytes
- glial cells that provide membrane extensions called myelin.
- myelin extensions wrap around axons of CNS neurons multiple times forming myelin sheath.
- Myelin sheath insulates axons, preventing current (ion) leaks à
speeds up conduction of electrical signals
- found in central nervous system 

Glia: Structure and Function
Schwann Cells 
- similar to oligodendrocytes, but found in peripheral nervous system 
- insulates axons in peripheral nervous system and speeds conduction of electrical signals 
- Notice more differences?

Glia: Structure and Function
Astrocytes 
- star-shaped 
- Hold neurons and blood vessels together - provide structural support to neurons
- transfer nutrients from blood vessels to neurons (e.g., glucose, amino acids, ions, etc.)
- actively involved in neural communication by forming tripartite synapses

The extension of astrocytes wraps around a synapse, forming a tripartite synapse
K. Smith 2010 Nature

Glia: Structure and Function
Microglia 
- smallest of the glial cells found in CNS 
- move around CNS looking for foreign bodies, viruses, bacteria, etc. 
- destroy infectious material or infected neurons by phagocytosis
